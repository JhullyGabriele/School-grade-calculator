School Grade Calculator in C

I developed an application in the C programming language designed to automatically calculate the number of students who passed a course, based on the evaluation model used in the Cobalto academic system, where a student is considered approved when achieving an average score of 7 or higher across two exams.

The system was designed to handle an undefined number of students, allowing continuous data input until a negative value is entered, which serves as the stopping condition. To enable this flexibility, I implemented a dynamic memory reallocation mechanism that expands the available storage as new data is added. This approach removes the need to predefine the number of records, overcoming the limitations of static structures and making the application more scalable and efficient in data management.

This project demonstrates proficiency in dynamic memory manipulation, control flow, algorithmic logic, and good programming practices in C, with a focus on efficiency and adaptability to varying input sizes.
