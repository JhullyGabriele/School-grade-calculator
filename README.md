# School Grade Calculator in C

A **C program** designed to automatically calculate the number of students who passed a course, following the evaluation model of the **Cobalto academic system**, where a student passes by achieving an average score of **7 or higher** across two exams.

## Features
- Handles an **undefined number of students** by allowing continuous input until a negative value is entered.  
- Implements **dynamic memory reallocation**, expanding storage as new data is added.  
- Eliminates the need to predefine the number of student records, making the application **scalable and efficient**.  
- Demonstrates good programming practices in C, including dynamic memory management, control flow, and algorithmic logic.

## How It Works
1. Users enter exam scores for each student.  
2. The program calculates the average of two exams.  
3. Students with an average of **7 or higher** are counted as approved.  
4. Input continues until a **negative value** is entered, triggering program termination.  
5. Dynamic memory allocation ensures the program can store all student records efficiently without predefined limits.

## Purpose
This project highlights:  
- Proficiency in **dynamic memory manipulation** in C  
- Algorithmic reasoning and **control flow management**  
- Writing efficient and adaptable programs for **variable-sized input**
